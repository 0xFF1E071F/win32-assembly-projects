How it works:
 	When you enable the Agent, it will automatically startup with Windows and add
 it's icon to the tray. From there you can quickly load WinAsm by double-clicking
 the icon. Additionally, you can make the Agent pre-load part of WinAsm Studio so
 it will run faster when you open it later.
 	The first step to install the Agent is to copy the addin's file (WAAgent.dll)
 in your addins folder (typically C:\WinAsm\AddIns).
 	Then, to enable the agent, and select which parts of WinAsm Studio to preload,
 you must first load the addin from the Addins Manager, then open the Agent
 settings dialog box (Add-Ins -> WinAsm Studio Agent Options).
