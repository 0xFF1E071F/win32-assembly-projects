To install, follow this steps:

1. Copy ResID.dll to your addins folder (typically C:\WinAsm\Addins).
2. Open the Addins Manager (Add-Ins -> Add-In Manager).
3. Select the addin and enable it. You can also set it to load on startup.

--------------------------------------oOo--------------------------------------

To use this addin, just place the caret where you want the resource IDs to be
imported from the resource script (typically somewhere in your .inc file) and
click Dialog->Insert resource IDs.

Important note: this addin works best if you switch the resource editor to text
mode at least once after making any changes. You don't need to save though.

To configure this addin, launch the Add-Ins Manager, select this addin and
click on the "Configure" button. A dialog box will pop up, from where you can
set up the following options:

    - Case: you can choose if the equate definitions should appear in uppercase
      ("EQU"), lowercase ("equ") or default case ("Equ").

    - Align: you can choose if the equate definitions should be aligned or not.
