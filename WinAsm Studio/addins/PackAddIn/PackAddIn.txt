EXE Packer Addin for WinAsm
® Mario Vilas (aka QvasiModo)
Version 2.0.2.2
Last updated 31 Aug 04

--------------------------------------oOo--------------------------------------

This addin automatically launches the an EXE packer after a project build has
 completed. It defaults to the UPX packer, simply because it's my favorite ;)
 but you can change that after installation.

For this add-in to work properly, the pathname and command line for UPX or a
 similar packer must be provided. You can set it in the config dialog
 (Add-Ins -> EXE Packer AddIn Options).

Additionally, you can keep several configurations, called "Profiles". This lets
 you, for example, change quickly from one packer to another. The default
 profiles are setup to be used with the following packers:

Instructions:

To install, follow this steps:

- Copy PackAddIn.dll to your addins folder (typically C:\WinAsm\Addins).
- Open the Addins Manager, and enable the addin.

To configure it, just select the menu option (Addins -> EXE Packer AddIn
 Options), and a popup dialog box will be shown. The addin must be enabled
 for this menu item to appear.

Additionally, you can manually edit the config file (WAAddIns.Ini) located in
 your AddIns folder. The settings are stored in the [PackAddIn] section.

--------------------------------------oOo--------------------------------------

Compatibility notes:

WinAsm Studio version 3.0.1.6 or above is required.

This addin was previously known as "UPX AddIn for WinAsm".

Versions prior to 2.00 used the [UPXaddinWA] section in WAAddIns.Ini to store
 the settings. It's contents are automatically moved to the new section the
 first time the addin is loaded.

Versions prior to 1.02 used C:\Windows\UPXaddin.Ini to store the settings.
 It's contents are automatically moved to the new file, and the old file will
 be deleted, the first time the addin is loaded.

 annoying XP themes bug in this addin, and much more :)
