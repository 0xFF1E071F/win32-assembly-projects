Install instructions:

To install, follow this steps:

1. Copy PFolder.dll to your addins folder (typically C:\WinAsm\Addins).
2. Open the Addins Manager (Add-Ins -> Add-In Manager).
3. Select the addin and enable it. You can also set it to load on startup.

--------------------------------------oOo--------------------------------------

Usage instructions:

This addin will just add a menu item that launches the current project folder
 in a shell Explorer window. It's functionality is basically similar to the
 "WinASM Explorer" addin by PhoBos.

You can configure the placement of this item by editing the file "WAAddIns.ini"
 located in your addins folder, under the section [Show Project Folder Add-In].

The key named "Caption" is the menu item's text, the "MenuPos" and "ItemPos"
 keys are the zero based index positions of the popup and item respectively.
 When ItemPos equals -1 the item is appended at the bottom of the popup menu.

Additionally you can insert a menu item separator. The "SeparatorPos" key sets
 the separator's position within the menu. A value of -2 (or simply removing
 the key) disables this feature. Since the separator is inserted before the
 item, when both the item and separator have the same position the item is
 placed above the separator.

This are the possible values for "MenuPos", and their meanings:
	 0: 	File
	 1: 	Edit
	 2: 	View
	 3: 	Project
	 4: 	Format
	 5: 	Dialog
	 6: 	Make
	 7: 	Tools
	 8: 	Add-Ins
	 9: 	Window
	10: 	Help

By default the Explorer window will be opened maximized. You can change that
 behavior by adding a new key to the addin's section, "ShowCmd", with one of
 the following values (note that they correspond to some of the SW_* equates):
	1:		Normal
	2:		Minimized
	3:		Maximized
	4:		Normal, don't activate
	7:		Minimized, don't activate

Some examples:

This are the default settings, places the item under Project -> Properties:

	[Show Project Folder Add-In]
	Caption=Show Project Folder
	MenuPos=3
	ItemPos=-1

This example does the same as above, but adds a separator too:

	[Show Project Folder Add-In]
	Caption=Show Project Folder
	MenuPos=3
	SeparatorPos=-1
	ItemPos=-1

This example places the menu item right under Tools -> Command:

	[Show Project Folder Add-In]
	Caption=Show Project Folder
	MenuPos=7
	ItemPos=11

This one makes the addin behave just like PhoBos's "WinASM Explorer":

	[Show Project Folder Add-In]
	Caption=Project folder...
	MenuPos=9
	SeparatorPos=0
	ItemPos=0
