How it works:
 	When you enable the Agent, it will automatically startup with Windows and add
 it's icon to the tray. From there you can quickly load WinAsm by double-clicking
 the icon.
 	The first step to install the Agent is to copy the addin's file (WAAgent.dll)
 in your addins folder (typically C:\WinAsm\AddIns).
 	Then, to enable the agent, and select which parts of WinAsm Studio to preload,
 you must first load the addin from the Addins Manager, then open the Agent
 settings dialog box (Add-Ins -> WinAsm Studio Agent Options).

Additional features:
 	Preloading: The Agent can pre-load parts of WinAsm Studio, so it will run
 faster. This includes the program itself, used addins, unused addins, keyword
 and API files, and/or the entire last used project.
 	Filetypes preserving: The Agent can automatically preserve WinAsm file type
 associations from external modifications. You need to have installed the Shell
 Integration Addin version 1.03 or higher for this feature to work.

Not implemented yet:
 	Updates checking: The Agent can automatically check for program or addins
 updates on the web. You can also do this manually from the tray icon menu.
